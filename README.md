# WeatherLogger-Using-Raspberry-PI

Basically Weather Logger runs a program where users can choose to record weather data like Temperature, Humidity, and Atmospheric Pressure, 
and then the user can choose to display all the data on the graph. 

We are implementing this on the SenseHat Simulator, which is an add-on-board for Raspberry Pi , made for the Astro-Pi mission. 
In this Temperature,Pressure,Humidity data will be collected from the Sense HAT and log it to a file. 
Then will use the PyGal module to display that data as a Bar graph.
